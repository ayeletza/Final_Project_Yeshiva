# Basic-AngularJS-App

A basic homework introduction to how AngularJS works using ngRoute to demonstrate loading of page templates and controllers based on URL hash fragments. 
In a client-side framework like AngularJS routing is managed not by the server, but by the front end itself. Angular detects the path of your URL and conventionally maps that URL to a controller and template.

Instructions:

0. Setting up project structure: directory and main pages (like: main viewport) to this repo
0. Add navigation menu to the Home Page. By clicking on any tab, displays different content using AngularJS Routing and databinding.
0. Edit this README file so it has your details, below (this is a private repository seen only by you and course stuff)
0. Make sure you see your commits before the excercise is due
